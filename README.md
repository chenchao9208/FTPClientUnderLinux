# FTPClientUnderLinux
FTP Client in CLI under Linux
Code and Report of the Internet Application course project.
The code is programmed several years ago in my undergraduate course.
Via several times upload/download, zip/upzid and open in different language environments, there occurs some weird messy code in the file.
Thus it may not run correctly now.
If you are intered in it, feel free to contact me for help.
